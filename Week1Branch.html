<p class="shadowed-text">Week 1 was an introduction to developing a growth mindset. We began by getting to know the leaders who will be part of this journey. Each person received a journal—a tool to help express thoughts and begin exploring their personal story. To truly understand our stories, though, we first needed to reflect on our coping skills. We wrapped up the week by discussing stress—what it is, how it shows up in the body, and how it can actually be your body's way of preparing you for a challenge. This naturally led us into exploring our Why—the deeper purpose behind our growth.</p>
    <p class="animated-text"> What stays hidden can't be healed. What stays blurry can't be fixed. But what's named can be navigated!</p>
